## About
My previous [portfolio website](https://snikerslala.github.io/previous-portfolio/) was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As I became a React Developer, I created a new portfolio project using my current skills.

This portfolio website was built using React 18 and Typescript, based on antd components. Some of the antd components were styled with styled-components to match the UI design and become responsive for small and large screens. Forms used in Budget app, which is a part of this portfolio project, were created with Formik and Formik-antd to be compatible with the antd components. Form fields were validated with a Yup schema. Moment.js was used in date related components. Redirections to pages was achieved using React-Router v6.

This portfolio website includes not only the showcase of my skils and projects. It contains also general information about me - who I am and why I am a React/Front-end developer.
